		## Corsairs of the Void**: (e.g. Eldar) This faction could embody the quintessential space pirate lifestyle, focusing on raiding, pillaging, and living off the spoils of war. They might operate from hidden bases and use hit-and-run tactics to survive in the harsh galaxy.
		## The Nomadic Marauders**: As their name suggests, this faction lives a nomadic existence, constantly on the move to avoid stronger forces and find new opportunities for plunder. They might have special bonuses for mobility and adaptability.
		## The Scrap Collectors**: A faction that thrives on scavenging the remnants of battles and derelict ships. Their origin could involve starting in a junkyard system rich in resources but requiring them to fend off other scavengers and pirates.
		## The Free Traders**: While not strictly pirates, this faction could represent a more lawful version of the freebooter lifestyle, focusing on trade, smuggling, and avoiding heavy regulations. They could have origins that involve escaping from a highly regulated home system to seek freedom among the stars.
		## The Outcasts**: This faction starts as a group of exiles or criminals who have banded together to survive. Their society might be built on a mix of piracy, trade, and mercenary work, giving them a diverse set of skills and a reputation as rogues and adventurers.
